# Highly opinionated meetings.

I have been in a lot of bad meetings in my career. I got so frustrated with the whole topic that I let myself get talked into participating in a special interest group on meetings and meeting hygiene years ago; what follows is my take on what came out of those discussions.

## Weird meeting times.

Rather than filling up full-hour blocks, I like to leave a little time before and after meetings -- this is particularly helpful if you wind up booked back-to-back fairly often, as it gives you a few minutes to switch contexts, run to the bathroom, grab a cup of coffee, take a few notes, etc. Accordingly, when given the option, I use the following standard meeting times:

* "Half-hour" meetings are really 20 minutes, "five after until five before", e.g.:
  * 2:05p-2:25p
  * 2:35p-2:55p 
* "Hour" meetings are really 45 minutes, "five after until ten before", e.g.:
  * 2:05p-2:50p 
* "Hour-and-a-half" meetings are really 75 minutes, "five after until ten before", e.g.:
  * 2:05p-3:20p
  * 3:35p-4:50p 
* "Two hour" meeting are really 105 minutes, "five after until ten before", e.g.:
  * 2:05p-3:50p

There are three corollaries to this meeting timing: meetings need to start on time \(no reason to be late since I built slack time into the beginning\); meetings need to end on time \(running over defeats the purpose of adding slack time to the end\); and meetings need to run quickly and efficiently \(see below for more on that\).

## Weird meeting scheduling.

This bit is more of a preference than a set of strict rules, but in general I feel like most of us wind up in too many meetings. We fill up the easy slots first, then we fill the early and late hours, eventually we start doing lunchtime meetings because that's the only place left with room on the schedule. Worst, we wind up with no extended blocks of time for concentration because every day has a meeting or two somewhere on the calendar.

So it's my goal \(which I admittedly often fail to achieve\) to schedule as follows:

* No meetings that start before 9am.
* No meetings that end after 4pm.
* No meetings during lunch \(12n-1p\), except for optional brown bag teaching sessions.
* No meetings on Mondays or Fridays.

Believe it or not, even with the above rules in place, there's still time for 18 hours of meetings in a standard work week.

## Purposeful meetings.

All good meetings start with two inputs:

First, an **attendee list**, with careful attention paid to mandatory vs optional status, and with the general rule being to keep the meeting as small as possible while still being useful. Meetings that sprawl to fifteen or twenty mandatory attendees tend to be both expensive and confusing. If what you're really doing is broadcasting specific information one-to-many, maybe use an email instead?

Second, a **published agenda**, hopefully with specific time allocations and identified discussion leader per topic. Particularly for recurring report-out-type meetings, if you can't identify particular agenda items, don't have a meeting. For some very specific types of meetings, it's okay to have the first agenda item be something like "build the meeting agenda proper" -- but that's not an excuse to skip drawing up a real agenda if appropriate.

All great meetings produce one or more of the following outputs:

A **consensus** around a topic: all attendees are now up to date and in agreement on whatever was talked about. Maintenance of group consensus \(many-to-many\) is one of the primary functions of meetings, and is also a good determinant of proper meeting cadence: the longer you go between consensus check-ins, the longer of a meeting you'll need to bring everyone in the group back into agreement, relative to the rate of change of whatever consensus is being maintained. This is why agile teams are so fond of fifteen-minute morning stand-ups: a quick check in on status since yesterday keeps everyone pulling in the same direction, and you don't need more than fifteen minutes because things haven't had very long to drift. On the other extreme, you may only need a strategic vision check-in once every year or two, since hopefully your strategic items are broad enough and stable enough to not change on a week-to-week basis.

The second important output of a meeting are the **decisions** made by the participants. Decisions should be documented clearly and usually publicly: who was the driver asking for a decision to be made; who were the participants in the discussion; what specifically was decided on what date; and a follow-up date for re-examining the decision in the future. It's okay if you couldn't come to a decision at a given meeting, but then there needs to be a follow-up action specified: drop the discussion and come back to it later when things have changed, or continue discussion at a subsequent meeting. Document even these inconclusive decisions for later review.

The third important output of a meeting are the **tasks** assigned and agreed to by the attendees. These should also be documented clearly for later reference: what task was assigned, who was the assignee, and what was the agreed-upon due date.

Decisions and tasks should be recorded as such by the meeting organizer or an agreed-upon delegate, and along with the agenda and attendees basically constitute the minutes of the meeting. I don't tend to take or publish detailed sentence-by-sentence notes of meetings -- if it's that important to know exactly who said exactly what, record the meeting and attach the recording to the meeting record.
