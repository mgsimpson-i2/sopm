# The spectrum of formality.

I see the word "maturity" used a lot in process development and
management, and I want to be very clear on how I mean it when I use
it, because otherwise some baggage tends to creep in: I don't believe
in maturity for maturity's sake, i.e. I don't use "mature process" as
a synonym for "good process". To me, maturity is about how long a
process has been around, how much effort we've decided to place on
standardizing it, and how much overhead we're willing to accept in the
interest of greater overall efficiency. So I'll tend to prefer
"formal" and "informal" in describing process, and occasionally
default to using "mature" as a synonym for "formal".

In general terms:

| Informal processes              | Formal processes                        |
| :---                            | :---                                    |
| Have lower overhead             | Have higher overhead                    |
| Are less efficient              | Are more efficient                      |
| Deliver made-to-order solutions | Deliver made-to-specification solutions |
| Offer personalized service      | Offer impersonal service                |
| Produce unique results          | Produce repeatable results              |
| Are less predictable            | Are more predictable                    |
| Are harder to delegate          | Are easier to delegate                  |

The value proposition for formalizing an informal process goes
something like: "This is something I do all the time, so if I put
effort into standardizing it, I'll get it done more quickly and with
less chance of error. If I really get it right, I'll be able to hand
it off to someone else entirely."

Note that there are lots of places \(high uncertainty in desired
outcome, desire to offer boutique/high-touch service, things we're
only going to do once or twice\) where you might want to let things
stay informal, i.e. where spending the overhead to standardize doesn't
get you much of a return on investment.

The classic example of a good place to push for formal process is
[what ITIL calls a service
request](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/itil-service-request-management/):
an activity that is standardized, low-risk, high-volume, and doesn't
require formal change management.

These days, the ultimate expression of a formalized process is
automation and orchestration -- let the stakeholder or customer push a
button to make it happen, and just record a successful execution for
later summarizing, or else send me a failure notification so I can
investigate.
