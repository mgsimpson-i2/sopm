# Introduction.

The tools we use define the work we do; it's impossible to do good work with bad tools.

Tool choice should start at the personal level: every technologist I've ever met has accumulated a long tail of favorite languages, platforms, frameworks, applications, and services that they use to get through the day. The worst thing you can do for individual productivity is to force someone to use a tool that they didn't choose and don't like. We do it anyway, all the time, sometimes for good reasons -- but I wish we wouldn't.

The next step is to convince the other people on your team that a particular tool that you like will also work for them: get them interested, show them how it makes things easier, more efficient, more elegant, and so on. If you can get most of your team to like a particular tool, then ask your team lead or other supervisor to make that tool an official part of the team technology stack.

Talk to other teams with whom you work, and see what tools they're using at the team level: maybe even let them convince you to try out some new options. If you find a common tool that's liked by multiple teams in your division or organization, make a case for elevating that tool further, to the division or organizational level. Do you have a document somewhere detailing what tools are considered standards for your organization? If not, why not? It'll certainly help with on-boarding.

When I say "elevate", I mean "pay for and manage at the next level up". I.e. you should be managing your personal toolkit, your team lead and fellow team members should be curating your team toolkit, and somewhere near the top of your org chart you should have a dedicated tools team taking excellent care of those top-level tools being used by everyone.

Grow your toolkits from the bottom up if at all possible. Top-down tooling doesn't work the way you think it will: you'll wind up with inappropriate tools that don't necessarily fit the context of the work being done, used by mandate rather than by desire. "Used by mandate" can turn into "quietly avoided at all costs", which is bad, bad, bad.
