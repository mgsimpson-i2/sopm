# Tools for communication.

All of the following came standard as part of my on-boarding process:

* [Outlook via O365](https://outlook.office365.com/) for email and calendaring. 
* [Slack](https://slack.internet2.edu/) for chat. 
* My cell phone for, uh, phone calls and texts. 
* [Zoom](https://zoom.internet2.edu/) for video conferencing.
