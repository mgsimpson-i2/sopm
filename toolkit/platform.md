# Base platform.

Here's what I start with:

*   A recent-vintage [Apple Macbook
    Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/), running [MacOS
    10.15.x](https://www.apple.com/macos/catalina/).

*   [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/) for password management,
    plus [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) for a few super-critical
    documents that I want access to everywhere.

*   [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) for hotkeys and general
    productivity enhancement, plus
    [Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704)
    to keep my laptop from sleeping when I'm giving a presentation,
    plus [Flux](https://justgetflux.com/) so that I don't wind up
    awake all night.

*   [iStat Menus](https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/) because once a
    sysadmin, always a sysadmin.

*   [Solarized palettes](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) for
    general eye-friendliness of any application that can use them.

*   [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) for command-line goodness.

*   [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) + [CLI
    tools](https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/install-command-line-tools-on-macos-catalina-anansewaa-com-6f8c63120fd8),
    mainly so I have gcc et al. installed for building various things
    -- I don't actually use Xcode as an IDE.

*   The [Oracle
    JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html),
    just because, you know, Java.

*   [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), for proper package-managed
    installation of anything that didn't come with MacOS.

*   \(via Homebrew\) [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and
    [Pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv), so
    I can maintain multiple different Python-based projects in a clean
    fashion, without polluting my system-level Python installation.

*   \(via Homebrew and "rustup"\) The [Rust
    toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/), because I'm fascinated
    with Rust even though no one else seems to care much. So I snuck
    this mention in here, just for fun.
