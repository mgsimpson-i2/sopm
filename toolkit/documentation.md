# Tools for documentation.

I like to write, and I love to draw pictures, so:

* Microsoft Excel, Powerpoint, and Word via [the O365 application suite](https://www.office.com/apps), because they came standard with my on-boarding, and because almost everyone uses them or can read their native formats. I will admit to really loving Excel, really hating Powerpoint, and really tolerating Word, but that's just me. 
* [OmniGraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle), my single most favorite application of all time, and the app that keeps me most wedded to Apple products because the thought of having to go back to Visio keeps me from sleeping at night. 
* [XMind](https://www.xmind.net/), because I'm a visual-spatial learner who tends to think \(and most importantly, brainstorm\) in hierarchical trees. I go through various phases of using various mind-mapping applications, but XMind currently has my loyalty, for whatever reason. 
* \(brand new, still in trying-it-out mode\) [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/), because why not back your online documentation with proper source code control? Alternatively, why not put your documentation right amongst your source code, and generate your docs as a build artifact just like your deployment packages? I'm still deciding how much I like Gitbook, but it feels pretty good so far.
