# General purpose tools.

* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) \(as the [Emacs for Mac OS X distribution](https://emacsformacosx.com/)\) for text editing, code development that isn't Java \(where I'd probably swap out for [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/)\), and every other random thing for which Emacs already has a major mode. 
  * I'm currently addicted to [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) \(for the second or third time\), making a heroic effort with the new job to make it my primary personal knowledge and time management tool. 
  * I also added [org-brain](https://github.com/Kungsgeten/org-brain) as a personal wiki/knowledge base -- still figuring out if I love it or not, but it has a lot of the basic functionality that I've wanted in terms of structuring and documenting bits and pieces of esoteric knowledge, bookmarks I don't want to lose, etc.
