# Teams part one, the Lencioni stuff.

I fully admit that I have a love/hate relationship with a lot of managerial literature, and when I was first handed "[The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756)" about ten years ago, I was highly skeptical. It wasn't until a few years later that I went back to it and actually read it \(focusing on the conceptual reference part at the back of the book, not so much on the narrative main story\). Over the years, I've grown more and more fond of the basic framework, which asserts that teams of people operate on a spectrum of trust, candor, and accountability, from low to high. Most importantly, the higher levels are built on the more fundamental stages: there's no skipping the line and going straight to higher levels of functionality; you have to do the hard work building from the bottom up.

## Mike's take on Lencioni's five stages of team maturity.

Without getting into too much theory \(I have a whole set of brown bag sessions I've taught a couple of times in the past if you ever want the deep-dive version\), here's a simple outline of the five stages of growth of a highly functional team. On the left are the dysfunctional behaviors, and on the right are the functional counterparts that take their place as maturity improves. Glancing through them, you should immediately get a feel for where any particular team that you're a part of currently lives.

### Step 1: Move from GUARDED to TRUSTING.

| Guarded | Trusting |
| :--- | :--- |
| Concealment of mistakes | Admission of mistakes |
| Hesitating to ask for help | Asking for help |
| Defensiveness when questioned | Openness when questioned |
| Jumping to conclusions | Giving the benefit of the doubt |
|  Not caring about other's expertise | Appreciating other's expertise |
| Focusing on politics and position | Focusing on getting work done |
| Never apologizing or accepting apologies | Offering and accepting apologies |
| Dreading interactions | Enjoying interactions |

### Step 2: Move from CAREFUL to CANDID.

| Careful | Candid |
| :--- | :--- |
| Quiet meetings | Loud meetings |
| Lots of politics and posturing | No politics or posturing |
| Personal attacks | Debating ideas and actions |
| Avoidance of controversy | Engagement with controversy |
| Many opinions go unaired | Everyone's opinions are voiced |
| Hard problems are deferred | Hard problems are addressed |
| Interactions leave people bitter | Interactions leave people tired |
| Anger and frustration | Passion and frustration |

### Step 3: Move from EQUIVOCATING to COMMITTED.

| Equivocating | Committed |
| :--- | :--- |
| Ambiguity about directions/priorities | Clarity about directions/priorities |
| Excessive analysis | Appropriate analysis |
| Lack of confidence | Confidence in abilities |
| Fear of failure | Willingness to fail |
| Constant discussion with no movement | Discussion leading to specific decisions and actions |
| Endless second-guessing | Root-cause analysis |
| Factions and finger-pointing | All together in the trenches |

### Step 4: Move from INDIFFERENT to ACCOUNTABLE.

| Indifferent | Accountable |
| :--- | :--- |
| Resentment over performance standards | High standards and mutual respect |
| Acceptance of mediocrity | Pressing for constant improvement |
| Missed deadlines and dropped deliverables | Careful promises and met expectations |
| Individuals succeed or fail | Team succeeds or fails |
| Assignment of blame | Acceptance of failure |
| Performance reviews | Professional development |
| Hierarchical discipline | Internal discipline |

### Step 5: Move from DISTRACTED to FOCUSED.

| Distracted | Focused |
| :--- | :--- |
| Stagnation | Growth |
| Wandering | Intentional |
| Reactive | Proactive |
| High turnover | High retention |
| Burnout | Engagement |
| Focus on status | Focus on success/failure |
| Focus on individual goals | Focus on organizational goals |

If you made it all the way through and you're reading this now, bless you. Let me take one last opportunity to restate what I said above: It is utter tomfoolery to think you can skip steps in this process. E.g. it would be ridiculous for me to demand that you be willing to be held accountable without first establishing commitment, built upon candor, built in turn upon trust. You have to start at the bottom and work your way up, period.
