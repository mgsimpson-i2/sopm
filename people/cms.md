# What I can do for you.

In addition to all of the more nebulous stuff in the preceding pages, there are three well-defined types of manager interactions I'm happy to have with you, either at regularly scheduled 1-on-1 check-ins or by request. The interactions are different enough that it's worth using the following terms in very specific ways:

* **Coaching**: Ask for a coaching session if you have a specific area of concern that you want me to help you explore, i.e. you're going to do most of the talking, and I'm just going to ask questions and act as a sounding board. I won't talk about myself or my own experience, I'll just ask leading questions to get you to explore the problem with your own expertise, and gradually work around to asking you about next steps, commitment and timelines, etc. The purpose of coaching is to help you develop your own thoughts and plan of action. 
* **Mentoring**: Ask for a mentoring session if you have a specific area of concern where you think I might have some good suggestions based on my own experience and career path. We'll discuss the problem at modest length, and I'll talk about how I've solved similar problems in the past, along with any technologies or techniques I think might be useful for you to explore. We might get as far as some recommended next steps, or at least agree on a roughed-out solution to try. The purpose of mentoring is for you and I to collaborate on figuring something out. 
* **Supervision**: Ask for a supervision session if you're having a problem or concern that you don't feel able to handle on your own, where you essentially want me to tell you what to do to try to fix it. I'll have you explain the area of concern to me, we'll talk about it a little bit, and I'll come up with a specific plan of action, the what and the when, to get moving on a solution. We'll likely establish some schedule of future check-ins to verify how things are going. The purpose of supervision is to quickly establish some direction and momentum that will make your life easier.

You may have noticed that the above three activities define a spectrum, where coaching puts the onus on you, supervision puts it on me, and mentoring floats around somewhere in the middle -- that's on purpose. Try not to get hung up on where you are in your career and what feels appropriate: I've needed various combinations of all three techniques throughout the last 25 years, irregardless of position or job duties.

Also note that it's normal to not be so intentional about an interaction: most 1-on-1's will generally wind up being a mixture of the three, probably mostly mentoring. But if you want to have a very specific type of interaction with me, it's great to use the terms above \("Mike, I would like a coaching session on ..."\) and it's also perfectly fine to call me out if you asked for one thing and I gave you something else \("Mike, I really wanted coaching, but this is starting to feel more like supervision ..."\).

Finally, I'll just admit that coaching in particular is a skill I'm personally still developing, so I'll probably slip up on a regular basis -- practice makes perfect.
