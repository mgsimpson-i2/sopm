# Starting assumptions.

## The individual and the system.

I draw my starting assumptions about everyone with whom I interact
from a combination of
[Deming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming) and
[Escalante](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Escalante):

*   You are a smart, capable professional;
*   Operating:
    *   With good intent,
    *   Under systemic constraints.

That's pretty much it.

To put it more informally: just about everybody I've ever worked with,
worked for, or supervised in IT was smart, skilled, and trying their
best to do the job right. Every one of them was also working within a
system of constraints imposed by the context of the job: resource
availability, outdated or invalid processes, bad or inappropriate
tools, lack of communication or insufficient information around
decisions being made, etc. These are all such normal parts of the work
that we almost take them for granted. But these system-level realities
are what are really determining the productivity and efficiency of the
work -- so maybe we should focus on the system when we're looking to
increase output or accuracy.

If you have the energy for it, Bob Marshall has a blog post with a
nice long list of some of those [non-obvious systemic
constraints](https://flowchainsensei.wordpress.com/2012/04/28/what-are-non-obvious-systemic-constraints/).

At the individual level, I want you to be happy about and engaged with
the work you're doing; have the right knowledge, resources, and tools
to get the job done; and have supporting process and structure that
organizes and manages the work without unduly getting in the way.

## Personal values.

It always feels a little awkward taking about personal values within a
work context, but everyone's doing it these days so here are my goals
for the values I try to espouse:

*   **INTEGRITY**: Be honest, respectful, and just.
*   **FLEXIBILITY**: Be open, adaptable, and eager.
*   **DETERMINATION**: Be focused, deliberate, and committed.
*   **COMPASSION**: Temper all of the above with kindness, caring, and humanity.

The last one is particularly important, I think -- without it, the
first three can get a little overwhelming.
